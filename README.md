## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
- **Permission Errors**:  
  Ensure that `vlc-protocol-register.bat` is run as an administrator. Elevated permissions are required for system-wide protocol registration.

- **Installation Path Issues**:  
  Confirm that VLC Media Player is installed in the default directory. If not, adjust the `.bat` files' location accordingly.

- **Browser Compatibility**:  
  Some browsers may need additional configuration to support custom protocols. Refer to your browser's documentation for enabling protocol handlers.
